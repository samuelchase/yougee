AAssign

Alice's Assignment:

There are two concepts on the abstract level that will have to be implemented.

1) A business:
	A Business is a farm, market or restaurant. The usual contact information name, email etc should be accessible for any business. 

2) A tag:
	Tags are things like "vegan", "non-gmo", "organic".

Every tag a business has a relationship such that for each business there is a
set of tags which have a number of points associated with them that indicate the business' strength in that area.

That is a business might have a set of tags associated as follows:
  
  'organic': 35 pts
  'local': 10pts
  'seasonal': 2pts

The final proj should be built such that the following queries are possible
with relative efficiency.

1) All businesses within x miles of lat_lng

2) All businesses for a certain set of Tags

3) All businesses within x miles of lat_lng AND for a certain set of tags

4) All businesses who names/address/website match directly by text

5) All businesses within x miles that match names/address/website directly by text

I believe this is more than enough functionality for the MVP.
